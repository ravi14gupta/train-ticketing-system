# train-ticketing-system
This project is a train ticket booking system implemented using Golang and gRPC. The system simulates the process of purchasing a train ticket, retrieving receipt details, viewing seat allocations, removing users from the train, and modifying user seat assignments. The data is stored in memory, and all results are outputted to the console.
